NAME: Brian Yee
UCID Number: 00993104
Tutorial Section: 02

=== 1. EXECUTION: ===

To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

	qmake -project QT+=widgets
	qmake
	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

	./a2

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

<Insert a precise user manual on how to interact with the program; eg. 
short-cut keys, mouse movements, menu items, widgets, etc.>

File Menu
	Reset (A) - Resets the model, view, and viewport.
	Quit (Q) - Quits the application

Mode Menu
	(View submenu)
		Rotate (O) - LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
		Translate (N) - LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
		Perspective (P) - LMB: FOV, MMB: near z-plane, RMB: far z-plane
	(Model submenu)
		Rotate (R) - LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
		Translate (T) - LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
		Scale (S) - LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
	Viewport (V)


== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

<Insert a description of the algorithms created and design decisions taken>

Used a single Matrix4x4 instead of storing scale, rotation, translation of the cube separately since 
the assignment says not to limit the amount of accumulated transforms.

//Stored the cube gnomon transform separate from cube class.

=== 5. PROGRAM ASSUMPTIONS: ===

It is ok to have View and Model submenus. (as seen in assignment example video)

=== 6. DECLARATION AND IMAGE PERMISSION: ===
