UCID Number: 00993104
Tutorial Section: 02

=== 1. EXECUTION: ===

To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

	qmake -project QT+=widgets
	qmake
	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

	./a2

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

<Insert a precise user manual on how to interact with the program; eg. 
short-cut keys, mouse movements, menu items, widgets, etc.>

[File Menu]
	Reset (A) - Resets the model, view, and viewport.
	Quit (Q) - Quits the application

[Mode Menu]
	[View submenu]
		Rotate (O) - Rotate view 
			LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
			
		Translate (N) - Translate view 
			LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
			
		Perspective (P) - Change FOV, near plane or far plane
			LMB: FOV, MMB: near z-plane, RMB: far z-plane
			
	[Model submenu]
		Rotate (R) - Rotate model
			LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
			
		Translate (T) - Translate model
			LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
			
		Scale (S) - Scale model
			LMB: x-axis, MMB: y-axis, RMB: z-axis
			
	Viewport (V) - Adjust the clipping area  
		Click and drag any mouse button.


== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

Primarily used a single Matrix4x4 instead of storing the rotation, translation values separately since the assignment implies that we should let transforms accumulate.  
However, the scaling transform is kept separate so it can be appended before applying any rotations and transformations.  (or else it resulted in non-axis stretching)
A transform is used to convert from NDC space to screen space, and the inverted matrix is used to go in the other direction.
View and Model submenus were included since the example assignment video also had them.

=== 5. PROGRAM ASSUMPTIONS: ===

We do not need to handle resizing the actual program window (the assignment does not mention it).

=== 6. DECLARATION AND IMAGE PERMISSION: ===

_BY_ I have read the regulations regarding plagarism. I affirm with my initials
that I have worked on my own solution to this assignment, and the code I am
submitting is my own.
